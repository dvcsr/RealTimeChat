This is the *Real-time Chat* project I made myself.

In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Use HTML and CSS to implement a basic chat page.
- Implement the input field, send button, and message container with JS and add more CSS styles.
- Implement the group chat using WebSocket with STOMP protocol.
- Implement a simple login. Extend the message structure and show the sender with the date.
- Add a new section that shows a list of online users.
- Allow users to switch between public and private chats.
- Implement sending and receiving private messages.
- Add counters near usernames in the user list that shows the number of unread messages, and move usernames of chatters to the top of the user list.
